# Mini Project: Data Engineering #1

> **My first small project to learn Data Engineering**

## Project Description

This folder contains a minimal end-to-end Data Engineering workflow:

1. **Web Scraping**: fetch job offers from Pracuj.pl and save raw data into a JSON file.  
2. **Data Loading**: ingest the JSON data into a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container.  
3. **Data Analysis**: open a Jupyter Notebook to run SQL queries against the database and draw insights.
